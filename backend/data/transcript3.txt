Well see, my-my wife's been getting on me a lot lately about trying to improve my health habits, and I really don't see what the big problem is. I mean, I've been working real hard. Sometimes I can't come home for dinner, so I'm having to go out to eat at Applebee's or something like that, so-- but she seems to have a bigger problem, I really don't see what the big deal is.
Okay, and so what I'm hearing is that you don't feel like your health is concerning you right now, or anything like that?
I-I-I feel fine.
Okay.
I mean, my-my work is really man-manual labor-intensive so I'm usually working out in-in the hot sun the majority of the day, so I'm usually sweating out any like bad things I put in my system, soâ€”
Okay. Have you noticed putting on any weight, or anything like--?
Well, a little bit, but nothing too-- you know. I'm not blo- I'm not bloated or anything.
Okay. Okay. And how about going to see the doctor? Have you gone to-- for a visit or anything recently?
Well, yeah, I've been to the doctor about maybe last year for a physical, but-- I mean, everything showed up to be fine, soâ€”
Okay. But you feel that you feel good?
Yeah.
Okay. Um, and so what I hear is that you're-- you feel like your wife might be, uh, overreacting to this?
Well, I mean, not really overreacting. I know that she loves me and I know she-she wants me, uh, you know, live a long time and be healthy, but just sometimes, especially if you work a hard job, like kinda going out to eat at these places kinda makes you feel a little bit better about your situation.
Sure. Sure. Okay. Um, and so one thing I'd just like to do is maybe give you some information on, um, maybe obesity or diabetes if you're interested or open to that. If you're, you know--?
Sure. [unintelligible 00:01:33]
Okay. Good.
