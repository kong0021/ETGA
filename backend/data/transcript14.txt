So you're sick of this?
Yeah. I-I just-- I can't shoplift anymore. You know, I got- I got caught again. And uh, you know, I-I got suspended, I got back to school, so I'm-I'm uh-- I'm gonna mess up my whole life here, unless I can stop this.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, it's bad. My friends and I, we just-- I mean, it's fun and uh-- so I don't know what to do, but I- but I gotta change.
Okay.
I want it.
So, it sounds like you're ready. You're ready to give this up.
Yeah.
But, maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear.
Right. I don't know what I'm gonna do, I got some friends. These guys are-- they're bad news, but they're my friends.
Mm-hmm.
And, uh, and it's fun.
And it's fun.
You know?
Mm-hmm.
Nothing-nothing much else going on that's as fun as this. We go in, we steal these CDs. It was working out fine, butâ€”
Uh-huh.
