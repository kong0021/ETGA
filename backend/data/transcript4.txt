Hi, Emily.
Hi.
It's been a while.
Yeah, it's been a while.
This is something new.
Oh, oh, yeah, theâ€”Yeah
You got your lip pierced. How long ago did you get that done?
About a month.
Hmm.
Yeah.
What made you decide to get-get a lip piercing?
Um, I don't know. I just felt like something different. I was getting bored and, I don't know, it's kind of nice to stand out a bit, I guess.
Hmm.
Yeah, change.
Yeah, and it looks nice.
Thanks.
Um, I guess, you know, as your dentist, I have- I have a couple of concerns about lip piercings, oral piercings. I wonder what have you heard about how having an oral piercing can affect your-your teeth or your gums?
I don't actually, really. I-I mean, I'm sure that it might push on my gums or teeth, but I don't know how much it will impact that much. I've pretty good teeth. I don't know.
Mm-hmm.
I don't really know [unintelligible 00:01:04]
You do. you have beautiful teeth as I always tell you-
[laughs] Thanks.
#NAME?
Yeah.
Um, I mean I have had some patients with oral piercings and they can erode some of the gum right, um, just right there at the front.
Mm-hmm.
Um, so that's one-one thing, and the other is, um, I do see fair amount of chipped teeth-
Oh, yeah.
#NAME?
Well, I definitely don't want it mess with my teeth. I know I kinda already have low gums to begin with, like you've been telling me for a while, and I have to flo-floss, which I-
Yes, flossing.
Um, which I'm not doing but, um, yeah, I guess, I don't really wanna wreck my teeth 'cause-- Yeah, I didn't really notice any of the chipping.
There's nothing yet.
I guess I'm not paying attention to it.
Yeah. There's certainly been-- There's no problems and you, as you said, only have had it for a short time.
Mm-hmm.
Um, what would- what would make you decide, "This is something that's not right for me?"
I don't know, I guess if I started to see that it was actually causing a problem, then I might.
Mm-hmm.
But for now-- I mean, I just got and-
Mm-hmm.
#NAME?
I guess that it does.
Yeah, I kinda-- Yeah.
Yeah, it looks nice. So, you want to monitor it and-and-
Yeah.
-really watch-
Yeah.
#NAME?
Yeah. I guess if I really start to see a problem-- I mean, this might not last forever, but my teeth, I'm hoping-
Mm-hmm.
-will kind of stick [unintelligible 00:02:30]
Emily, you said it so well it-
Yeah.
-the-the piercing might not last forever, but your teeth really are-
Yeah.
-hopefully forever. So, okay, well thanks for-for talking about it-
Yeah.
-with me, and also before I do the exam, you know, I'm always on your case about flossing, so maybe we can take [inaudible 00:02:46]-
