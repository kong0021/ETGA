Therapist: Good afternoon, Alice. How have you been feeling since our last session?
Alice: I've been struggling with managing stress at work. It feels overwhelming.
Therapist: Let's explore some strategies to help you cope better. Have you tried any relaxation techniques?
Alice: I've been doing some deep breathing exercises, but they don't seem to work well under pressure.
Therapist: Let's work on integrating mindfulness practices into your daily routine. It could help you stay more centered.
Alice: That sounds like a good idea. I'll give it a try this week.
