Therapist: Hi Alice. It's good to see you again. How have things been going?
Alice: I've had a rough week. The stress at work piled up again.
Therapist: Let's revisit some relaxation techniques and see how we can tailor them to your current situation.
Alice: I think I need more strategies to manage this consistently.
Therapist: We can work on that. Let's start by identifying triggers and responses.
