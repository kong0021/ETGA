So, again, I hear your overall goal is really, to not give up these things you'd like but to cut back on how much you have-
Yeah, I guess so.
-on that. All right. So, I'd like to ask you, uh, kind of a scaling question about this 'cause I'm hearing that this feels really important to you that you'd be way up there on the high- on the high end of importance.
Yeah.
So, I'm gonna ask the question this way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident, and 10 is like, "I'm very, very confident," where would you put yourself on a scale right now of confidence in starting this new plan?
Right now, I'm probably-
Mm-hmm.
gonna say a six.
A six.
But I know when I go home and I see the food, it's probably gonna drop back down to a four.
Okay. All right. So, let's talk about that, um, so we should just assume we're gonna be at a four.
Right?
Okay?
I guess.
So, why are you at a four and not even a lower number? Why are you not like a zero or a one?
Because I've been wanting to do this for-for years, like-
Okay.
ever since I started becoming conscious of my body.
Okay.
Like ever since I started being a teen, like this has always been a goal of mine, like, especially 'cause all my friends play soccer, and like-
Uh-huh.
hike, and are like super stick-thin but really healthy and active.
Okay.
And so I'm just sort of like, well, I'm not.
Okay.
But I want to be like-- I don't want to be like stick-thin, but I really want to be like really healthy and really active.
Okay.
And like be able to look nice, you know.
Okay, all right.
I wanna be able to look nice.
Okay. So, what would help increase that confidence? What-- Because that sounds like where we really need to focus on. What's gonna help you feel more confident about this?
I don't even really know-
Mm-hmm.
-honestly. Like, I mean, I know I'm gonna have to keep like telling myself like-
Mm-hmm.
-like this is something that you want- that you've wanted-
Uh-huh.
for years.
Uh-huh.
Like, you can do it. Because like-
Okay.
I know I can do it. Like I can do anything.
All right.
I can do anything-
All right.
-I know that. But it's hard getting to the point where I-
Okay.
do something.
All right. Well, if it's okay, just for a moment, let's put the- let's put the changing the eating pattern off to the side, and let's take a look at some other time in your life that there was something you really wanted to accomplish and you did. And what is it about you- what was it about you? What kind of strengths did you bring to the table that allowed you to tackle something that felt like a challenge and-and allowed you to be successful?
