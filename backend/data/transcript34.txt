Therapist: Hi Michael. How have you been since our last session?
Michael: I had a setback with the presentation. It didn't go as well as I hoped.
Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's talk about what happened and how you're feeling.
Michael: I felt overwhelmed and blanked out during some parts.
Therapist: It's understandable. Let's work on managing performance anxiety together.
